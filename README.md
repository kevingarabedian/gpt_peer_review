To use this updated class, you can first create an instance of it with your GitHub access token and OpenAI API key. Then, you can call the `CheckForNewPullRequestsAndPostComments` method periodically to check for new pull requests and post comments with suggested changes on them. The method will only post comments on pull requests that have not been commented on by the app before.

You can still use the `CreatePullRequest` method to create new pull requests with suggested changes. Note that the `diff` parameter is now optional and will only be used if you want to suggest changes when creating the pull request.

Here's an example of how you might use this updated class:

```csharp
var accessToken = "your-github-access-token-here";
var openAiApiKey = "your-openai-api-key-here";

var reviewer = new GitHubPullRequestReviewer(accessToken, openAiApiKey);

var repositoryName = "openai/gpt-3";
var baseBranchName = "master";
var headBranchName = "my-feature-branch";
var title = "My Pull Request";
var body = "This is my pull request.";

var pullRequestUrl = await reviewer.CreatePullRequest(repositoryName, baseBranchName, headBranchName, title, body);

Console.WriteLine($"Created pull request: {pullRequestUrl}");

while (true)
{
    await reviewer.CheckForNewPullRequestsAndPostComments(repositoryName);
    await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5));
}
